Chocolate is a library containing additions to Cocoa and Cocoa Touch that
simplify writing Objective C code for OSX/iOS. The things that Apple forgot.

Chocolate consists of three modules:

1. [Foundation Additions][FoundationAdditions] - Categories on the Foundation classes. These
   are intended to be useful for all Objective C code.

2. [Core Data Additions][CoreDataAdditions] - Categories on Core Data classes.

3. [Testing Additions][TestingAdditions] - Categories on Foundation classes that provide
   functionality useful when writing Unit Tests. These are not
   intended to be linked in the actual Application code.

## Usage

Chocolate is published as a [CocoaPod][CocoaPods], with each the
three modules above listed as a separate subspec.

For example, to use Chocolate's [Foundation Additions][FoundationAdditions], add the following to your `Podfile`

    pod 'TDTChocolate/FoundationAdditions'

then run

    $ pod install

and finally import the public header for the [Foundation Additions][FoundationAdditions] subspec

    #import <TDTChocolate/TDTFoundationAdditions.h>
